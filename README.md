# SmartShoppingCartWith555Timers
Non coding Project (Linear Integrated Circuit Project)
In this project, the system will ensure that the customers will have the best and convenient shopping experience. Rather than influencing the clients to hold the shopping cart and push it every time to follow them, this framework helps in mechanizing the easy and comfortable line following process by detecting black path on the floor and thereby following it.
